# Instacreep
Look at instagram w/o logging in. Original functionality.
This chrome extension simply removes the added child modal from the body and sets the body element style overflow: scroll !important to enable continued use without logging in. You CANNOT interact w/ anyone. This tool is simply to BROWSE I.E. CREEP


For easy use, simply go to chrome://extensions/ select load unpacked and choose the folder. Happy browsing =)
